Lunar Numbat Orbit
==================

Introduction
------------

Orbit (or more precisely, Lunar Numbat Orbit) is a series of scripts
for producing orbital data (telemetry) for an object moving in the
Earth-Moon system.

It is a work-in-progress.

Programs
--------

orbit.pl 

  This is the main script which simulates the motion of an object
  travelling in orbit in the Earth/Moon system.

  The 'stdout' of this program contains the 'telemetry' for the object
  in the form of:

  ----
  rtc:1234529684
  t:1
  x:6471
  y:22.372
  vx:0
  vy:11.186
            <---- blank line
  rtc:1234529685
  t:2
  x:6471
  y:33.558
  vx:0
  vy:11.186
  ----

orbit-display-stream.pl

  This script reads in the 'telemetry' data on stdin and displays it
  along a single line, in the form:

  ----
  t:1            x:6471.000     y:22.372       vx:0.000        vy:11.186       
  t:2            x:6471.000     y:33.558       vx:0.000        vy:11.186 
  ----

  This is suitable for monitoring the changes in raw data.

orbit-display-curses.pl

  Requires: libcurses-perl

  This script reads in the 'telemetry' data on stdin and displays it
  in a full screen curses display.
